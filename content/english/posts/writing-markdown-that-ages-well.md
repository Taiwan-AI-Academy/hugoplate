Prefer short files, descriptive headings, and local examples. Future you will thank you for removing jokes and adding a `Last updated` note when facts change.

- Link to source files instead of screenshots so updates stay in sync.
- Keep code fences runnable where possible and note dependencies inline.
- When in doubt, cut adjectives and ship a diagram instead.
