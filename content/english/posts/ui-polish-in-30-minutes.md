Run this sprint-friendly checklist when an interface feels off:

- Tighten spacing by standardizing padding tokens and removing stray margins.
- Anchor text styles to two headline sizes and one body size to avoid randomness.
- Add subtle focus states so keyboard flows remain visible.
- Swap blurry assets for SVGs or WebP exports to reduce layout shift.

Small touches compound; ship the pass and iterate rather than wait for perfect mocks.
